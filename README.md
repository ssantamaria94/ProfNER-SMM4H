# ProfNER-SMM4H
Code relative to the participation of the Troy&AbedInTheMorning team in the [ProfNER-ST: Identification of professions & occupations in Health-related Social Media](https://temu.bsc.es/smm4h-spanish/).

## ProfNER-ST
Our proposed system is based on an encoder-decoder architecture with an attention mechanism powered by a combination of word embeddings that include pre-trained fine-tuned spanish BERT embeddings.

The developed code is [here](https://github.com/ssantamaria94/ProfNER-SMM4H/blob/main/ProfNER.ipynb) while the fine-tuned BETO proccess can be found [here](https://github.com/ssantamaria94/ProfNER-SMM4H/blob/main/BETO.ipynb)
